# TinyGoalsBigImprovements

The goal of the app is to improve productivity in self improving tasks by setting utterly embarrasingly tiny goals a week. These goals lead to productivity boosts in tasks like workout, reading, studying, development, etc. One of such goal would be: do ten push ups a day, read two pages a day, run once around your house, etc.
